Codebook.md describes the modifications done and descriptions of codes and measurements
The original data is modified by 
  (1) merging the testing and training measurements
  (2) selecting only the columns containing mean and standard deviations
  (3) using activity names instead of acitvity codes
  (4) replacing all abbreviations with right labels
  (5) creating a tidy data set of avergae of all variables grouped by subject and activity

Descriptions of Codes
  (1) Subject (Individual's ID and the range is 1-30)
  (2) Activity Codes and Labels (6 activities - Walking, Sitting, etc) 
  (3) features (561 variables which are measured like Accelerometer mean, Gyroscope max, etc)
  (4) Test and Train data measurements are made for 561 variables in X_train/test.txt and the labels are in y_train/test.txt
